    "\n",
    "- Using personal notes, books, the online course materials or other on-line documents is permitted.\n",
    "- It is forbidden to communicate with other individuals.\n",
    "- ChatGPT or similar tools are permitted, but you need to declare that you use them. The use of such tools will NOT be taken into account in the grading process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download (from Brightspace):\n",
    "    - `exam.ipynb`: this Python notebook\n",
    "    - `fib_true.txt`, `fib_false.txt`: two text files with numbers; you may use these files to test your code in the Fibonacci sequence question (1.D.).\n",
    "    - `msleep.csv`: a CSV-formatted table needed for the data manipulation and visualization questions (2.).\n",
    "2. Edit `exam.ipynb` to answer each question:\n",
    "    - Below each question there is one cell which you need to fill in with the Python code solving the question.\n",
    "    - The complete answer needs to fit in the single cell.\n",
    "    - The first line of the cell contains a comment with a ChatGPT declaration. You have two options `NO/YES`. Please leave `YES` if you have used ChatGPT (or a similar tool) to solve the question. Otherwise leave `NO`.\n",
    "4. Submit (in Brightspace):\n",
    "    - Submit the `exam.ipynb` file in Brightspace. You may submit more than once. The last submission will be graded.\n"
